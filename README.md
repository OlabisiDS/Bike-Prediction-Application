# Bike-Prediction-Application
This repository contains the code and model for predicting bike demand using machine learning. The project leverages historical data to forecast future bike rentals, which can help bike-sharing companies optimize their operations.
Contents bike_app.py: The main Streamlit app for interacting with the model.
bike_model: The trained XGBoost model used for making predictions.
bike_X_test.pkl: Test data features used for evaluating the model.
bike_y_test.pkl: Actual test data labels used for evaluating the model.
